# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview

In this project, I was tasked to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. "Crypto" is an undiscovered wilderness for Accountability Accounting, and they need my analytical skills in order to navigate it. I am going to use my machine learning skills in order to provide some guidance to Accountability Accounting.
